# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction

A machine learning project to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient data.  
The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## 📚 Highlights
- **Features**: Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, RestingBP, Cholesterol, FastingBS, RestingECG, MaxHR, ExerciseAngina, Oldpeak, ST_Slope, HeartDisease.
- **EDA**: Visualized distributions, pairplots, and correlations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features to enhance model performance.
- **Model Performance**:
  - Test Accuracy: **88%**
  - Cross-Validation Score: **87%**
- **Goal**: Build a reliable model that generalizes well on unseen data.
